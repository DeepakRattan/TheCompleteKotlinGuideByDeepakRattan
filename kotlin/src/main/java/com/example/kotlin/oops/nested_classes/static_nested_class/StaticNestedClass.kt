/**
 * Created by Deepak Rattan on 18/5/20.
 * Topic : Nested Class\
 * Description : 1. Kotlin allows you to define a class within another class known as nested class.
 * 2. The nested class in Kotlin is similar to static nested class in Java.
 * 3. A nested class in Kotlin with no explicit modifiers is the same as a static nested class
in Java. To turn it into an inner class so that it contains a reference to an outer class,
you use the inner modifier.
 4. Nested class (doesnâ€™t store a reference to an outer class) Like static class in java
